\chapter{Remaining Work and Planning Ahead}

\section{Charger Module Completion}

Although the charger circuit is designed and the MCP73831 IC is ordered, delivery delays mean we might not be able to complete this part before the final deadline. We plan to discuss this with our faculty and request appropriate accommodations.

\section{Enclosure Design}

The plan was to make the system wearable — possibly like smart glasses. However, due to uncertainty in circuit dimensions and size, we may pivot to a more conventional box-style enclosure.

\textbf{New Plan:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compact rectangular enclosure with buttons and ports exposed.
    \item Increased safety by keeping LiPo battery enclosed and away from the user’s face.
    \item Easier to prototype and manufacture quickly using 3D printing or acrylic fabrication.
\end{itemize}
