\chapter{Conclusion}

The QR Code Scanner project was not only a learning opportunity but also a creative engineering endeavor. It encompassed embedded systems, electronics hardware design, real-time computer vision, and web-server integration — making it a well-rounded interdisciplinary project.

Key takeaways include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Understanding the real-world limitations of voltage regulators and power electronics.
    \item Working around hardware availability constraints by creatively adapting modules.
    \item Integrating a full-stack system: from camera sensing on an ESP32, to server-side decoding, to real-time messaging via Telegram.
    \item Dealing with bugs, flashing issues, and decoding limitations — and learning to design around those constraints.
\end{itemize}

While the project is not perfect, it has shown us the value of adaptability and the power of embedded computing when paired with cloud integration.

We hope that with a few final tweaks — especially to the charger and the enclosure — our QR scanner will be a working, demo-ready product. Regardless, the process has already taught us far more than a simple classroom assignment ever could.
